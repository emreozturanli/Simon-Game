# Simon-Game

In this project I tried to do a copy of Simon Game. 

This was one of the projects in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp Course on Udemy.

With this project I learned and understood <strong>jQery</strong> better.

[Here](https://emreozturanli.github.io/Simon-Game/) is the link for the website. Go play and have fun ðŸ˜€
